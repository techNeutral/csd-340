            <!--Added spans around each person's name in the following paragraphs and changed them to underscores-->
            <p id="p1" class="intro MyStory">
                Hello, my name is <span class="blank" id="me">_____</span> from Omaha, Nebraska. I have been working in IT for almost 20 years and over time 
                I have come to enjoy the  parts of my job that involve programming far more than any of the others. 
                As a result, here I am now attending Bellevue University attempting to learn how to program the correct way, 
                instead of piecing together random pieces of information on the internet to put something together that feels 
                like it is held together with shoe strings and bubble gum.
            </p>
            <p id="p2" class="MyStory">
                <span class="sentence">I am happily married to my wife <span class="blank" id="wife">_____</span> and a father of two young boys.</span> 
                My oldest, <span class="blank" id="oldest">_______</span>, is 7 years old and is really into sports and video games. 
                <Span class="blank" id="youngest">_______</Span>, my 5 year old, loves playing with toys and is a natural collector. 
            </p>
            <p id="p3" class="MyStory">
                I am not currently employed because I knew that if I tried to do work, school, and be a good dad at
                the same time one of those things would end up getting a lot less attention than the others.
                I am also pretty sure that because kids do not have solid deadlines it would be my kids and that ended up 
                getting the least attention and did not seem fair to them. So instead I spend a lot of time running my kids
                 back and forth to school, swimming lessons, and helping to coach their baseball / tee ball teams, while 
                 just hanging out to watch them in other sports and practices. 
            </p>
            <p id="p4" class="MyStory">
                For hobbies I like to play a lot of golf, even though I am bad at it. I have always loved video 
                games since I was a small child, but I find it hard to find the time to play them as much as I 
                would like, so most of my engagement with games these days comes from podcasts and online videos. 
                Recently I have become obsessed with pickleball, and while I am struggling to find time to play 
                video games I find myself playing pickleball multiple times a week.
